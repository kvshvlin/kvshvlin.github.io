**Here's my business model**.

Here you can see what I've shipped recently, what I'm building next, and how I'm doing as an architect. By sharing this information I aim to demystify the weird and wonderful process of working on mostly bootstrapped <a href="https://kushalsamant.github.io/projects.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">projects</a>/<a href="https://kushalsamant.github.io/articles.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">articles</a>.

I'm working my hardest to build a space that's mindful, respectful, and accountable to my patrons. I've lots of ideas for how to do a better job, as well as lots of challenges. This is meant to be as transparent as reasonably possible. If there's something you don't see here that you'd like to know, then you should @me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/kushalsamant_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

Since I'm accountable to my patrons instead of advertisers, my incentive is to create meaningful content. This also means that my future relies entirely on community contributions.

Here's how you can help: If you are already following my content and want to chip in a little extra, you can explore, join, shop, or subscribe to the following bootstrapped projects.
