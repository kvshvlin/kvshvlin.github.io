**Here's how this works**.

I create architectural designs on postcards. I scan these architectural designs. I submit these scans to Your&nbsp;Mail&nbsp;Project for merchandising apparel & bags, bed & bath, face masks, furniture, home decor, office, outdoor & lifestyle, tabletop, tech, wall art, &c. You can shop this merch on Your&nbsp;Mail&nbsp;Project's <a href="https://www.society6.com/yourmailproject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Society6 account @yourmailproject</a>.

I collate these scans every month to create issues for Your&nbsp;Mail&nbsp;Project's architectural magazine. You can download any issue of Your&nbsp;Mail&nbsp;Project's architectural magazine from their <a href="https://www.gum.co/yourmailproject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gumroad account @yourmailproject</a> at a pay-what-you-want price starting from Rs.&nbsp;75.00.
